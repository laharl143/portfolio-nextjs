  description: `My name is Erskine Duenas but you can call me "ED". I am a developer with 2 years of professional experience as a Full-Stack Software Engineer, specializing in Back-End Development. I am a quick learner with a self-learning attitude. I view myself as a "lifelong learner," eager to deepen my understanding of technological advancements and stay updated with the latest technologies. I'm keen on embracing discomfort and regularly learning something new. This is my approach to lifelong learning and growth. My core skill is based on JavaScript and I love to do most of the things using JavaScript. I am available for any kind of job opportunity that suits my skills and interests.
