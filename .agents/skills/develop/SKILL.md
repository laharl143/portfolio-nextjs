<!-- CODEX-COMPATIBILITY:START -->
## Codex compatibility

In Codex, these mappings override Claude-specific instructions in this skill and its supporting files:
- Read SKILL.md and supporting files directly. To invoke another skill, read its installed SKILL.md; there is no Claude Skill tool.
- For questions in Codex, use the exposed request_user_input_async tool, or request_user_input only in Plan mode. For stage handoffs follow the Next step panel below: recommend the next ready action and present native clickable choices. An actual selection authorizes that named step; the immediate return or a preselected option does not. There is no AskUserQuestion or Skill tool in Codex.
- For an explicitly requested new chat, use create_thread if available. Never call mcp__ccd_session__start_session or assume /clear works. Otherwise continue in the current chat.
- For explicitly prescribed subagent work, use collaboration tools. Scout and researcher describe tasks, not required agent types. Follow current model-inheritance rules. Never pass haiku, sonnet, opus, or fable as Codex model IDs. When overrides are supported and permitted, choose an available Luna for lightweight work or Sol/Astra for difficult work.
- Cross-model review: confirm the actual author model with the user or reliable task metadata; Claude settings and ANTHROPIC_MODEL do not identify the Codex author. Use a different available strong model only if overrides are permitted. Otherwise use an available code-review tool or fresh-context reviewer and disclose that model independence is unverified. Never claim a different-model review without evidence.
- Resolve personal skills under ~/.agents/skills and project skills under .agents/skills. Claude settings.local.json, skillOverrides, and plugin enable flags do not configure Codex; use supported Codex configuration and plugin tools.
- Named dependent skills and plugins must actually be available. Report missing dependencies rather than inventing tools or claiming they ran.
<!-- CODEX-COMPATIBILITY:END -->

## Output style (plain words, no dashes, no hyphens)

<!-- OUTPUT-STYLE:START -->
Write everything this skill produces, files and messages alike, in plain simple language. Talk to the reader as `you`, warm and direct like a colleague, and present every step as a recommendation they may run or skip, never an order. Keep technical terms that carry real meaning; explain each in plain words. Never use a dash or a hyphen as punctuation: no em dash, no en dash, and no hyphenated compounds. Write `read only`, not `read-only`. Say it in simple words, or reword the sentence. Code, file paths, command flags, and values other skills match on keep their hyphens. Use short sentences, commas, or parentheses. Clear beats clever.
<!-- OUTPUT-STYLE:END -->

## Next step panel (clickable, no typing)

<!-- NEXT-STEP:START (identical in every workflow skill: architect, audit, check, debug, develop, document, log, scope, sync, test; edit all or none) -->
At the end of each completed, failed, or blocked stage, give a concrete recommendation and clickable choices. The user should be able to choose the next skill with a mouse, without typing a command or asking what comes next. This section overrides older handoff formatting elsewhere in this skill for Codex.

1. Finish the authorized work and report its real result first. Read this feature's current scope, spec status, workflow tier, unchecked boxes, and any failure or prerequisite. Recommend the first useful action that is actually ready, with one short reason. A failed check routes to its fix, not to the next success stage. Do not repeat a completed stage or require the user to work out the sequence.
2. Offer 2 to 4 choices, including `Stop here`. Put the best next action first and mark it `(Recommended)`. Give each action a plain name, the feature, and a short explanation, for example `Develop lead intake (Recommended): Build the approved spec in this chat.` Add only alternatives that this result supports. The interface already provides free text, so do not add an `Other` option.
3. In Codex, prefer `functions.request_user_input_async` when exposed. This is a preference question about the next action. Use one question with `title` such as `What would you like to do next for lead intake?` and `options` as an array of those choice strings. Make it the last tool call after all work and reporting. It returns immediately, so follow it only with a brief, self contained final summary and the recommendation. Do not cancel or replace the pending question by starting another stage.
4. Wait for the user's actual reply. Preselection, the tool's immediate return, elapsed time, and Skip are not authorization to run the recommended choice. Stop or Skip means no further action. If the reply arrives later, use the pending question and feature context to interpret it without asking for the command again.
5. A clicked action authorizes that named next step. Read the selected skill's installed `SKILL.md` and run it with the feature, spec, and relevant failure carried forward. Do not ask the user to type the command, repeat the selection, or confirm the same step. The chosen skill's real prerequisites and existing external action permissions still apply.

Choose recommendations from evidence, not a fixed sequence:

| Result | Usual recommendation, if the project's recorded workflow supports it |
| --- | --- |
| Audit finished | Scope the next work if no scope exists, otherwise the matching feature's next ready step. |
| Scope finished with a decision owed | Architect that named feature. If already designed, offer its next unchecked execution step. |
| Architect finished with an approved buildable spec | Develop the same feature. If a decision is still open, recommend resolving or ratifying it first. |
| Develop finished | Check verify for the same feature when its Verify box exists. Otherwise follow its tier and next unchecked box. |
| Check verify passed | Test at Beta or GA when its Test box remains, otherwise the next recorded closing step. |
| Check verify failed | Debug the observed failure. For a confirmed unbuilt surface, Develop that surface instead. |
| Check blocked | Explain the exact missing prerequisite and offer the action that resolves it, or a recheck after the user completes the outside setup. Never offer to bypass the block silently. |
| Debug fixed the reported issue | Repeat the check that failed, then the remaining regression test stage if recorded. |
| Test passed | The next required review or documentation stage, or offer marking done if this feature's closing checks are complete. |
| Review found issues | Fix the concrete finding with Debug or Develop before another review. A clean review follows the recorded documentation or integration step. |
| Document, Sync, or Log finished | Recommend the next remaining recorded step, or the next scoped feature when this one is closed. If nothing remains, say so and offer Stop. |

Do not offer `Mark done` while a known failure or blocker remains. If the build is complete and the user may explicitly skip optional remaining stages, name exactly which checks that choice skips and never make it the recommendation over fixing a failure. Only a real user selection may invoke the existing done flow: surgical scope/spec updates, tracker mirroring, and the project's authorized commit and push rules. An Assumed spec stays Assumed and flagged for ratification.

Use the current chat by default. Offer `New chat: ...` only when a fresh context would materially help and a supported `create_thread` tool exists. Label it explicitly; selecting it authorizes a new chat, so use the available project/thread tools and include the exact task, feature, spec, and unresolved state. Never call `mcp__ccd_session__start_session`, never assume `/clear` can be run by a tool, and do not make a new chat mandatory for an ordinary next step.

If the asynchronous picker is unavailable, use `functions.request_user_input` only in Plan mode when exposed. On another runtime use its available native choice tool. In Codex Desktop, when no permitted picker exists but followup controls are supported, put clickable action items in the final answer using the app's exact unescaped syntax, with the full skill command and feature in each action prompt. For Stop, use an explicit instruction to stop rather than inventing a skill command:

`- :codex-followup[Develop lead intake (Recommended)]{prompt="/develop lead intake form"}`

Do not substitute a plain typed command list when a permitted clickable control exists. If no clickable interface is available, state that limitation and give the concrete recommendation with short numbered choices. Do not fabricate a tool, a radio panel, or an action that the client cannot render.

Show one next step menu per finished stage, after any required artifact or design decisions. Do not show it in the middle of work, duplicate it with another picker, or use a generic `What next?` without an evidence based recommendation.
<!-- NEXT-STEP:END -->

## What this skill does

The builder: turns a spec plus project conventions into working code. Tracks: **UI** (components, pages, layouts; `ui-guide.md`), **Logical** (APIs, services, data layers, business logic, integrations; `logical-guide.md`), or both (e.g. "auth" = sign in pages plus session logic → run both). Step 0 gates on the spec so load bearing choices (an auth approach, a payment provider) are decided in `/architect`, not silently invented partway through the build.

## Asks vs acts

Gates, then acts: no upfront question rounds like `/architect`. Read the decision, build, ask only what the design left open (the visual direction when no reference was given; a business rule the spec didn't settle). Infer from the spec, `AGENTS.md`, and codebase; recommend local implementation choices.

## Artifact ownership

- Writes app code (plus CSS/tokens for UI).
- Scope (`docs/scope/`): only the Step 4 touches (feature status → `in-progress`, milestone sub boxes, `Build it` box, code pointer). Marks a feature `done` only at the `Prototype` workflow tier (build plus its own self check; the engineer opted out of separate verification); an `Assumed` spec does not block this, it stays flagged as owing ratification. At `Alpha`/`Beta`/`GA` it leaves the feature `in-progress` for `/check verify` and `/test` to close, and never ticks `Verify it` or `Test it`. Never creates files in `docs/scope/` (scopes only; analysis/research is `/architect`'s, in the spec's `rationale.md`).
- Never writes spec content or deliberates a decision (flags the need, defers to `/architect`); never restructures root `AGENTS.md` (that's `/audit`); new area conventions go via `/sync` afterwards. **One narrow exception:** on `Build now, record it as an assumed spec` (Step 0), `/develop` may *create* a spec, but only in `Status: Assumed`, and only the assumption record fields (owed decision, assumption built on, authorized by, code area, requirements seeds). It never writes rationale and never advances an `Assumed` spec past that state; `/architect` owns clearing it. This is the only spec `/develop` creates.
- One spec touch on an existing spec: the `**Status**:` line (umbrella decision → the `index.md`'s, never a child's), plus filling the feature's spec pointer line. Build start: `Proposed` → `In Progress`; build lands (feature → `done`): `In Progress` → `Accepted` (a spec is not `Accepted` until its feature ships). Never edit spec content, only that line, surgically: read it again right before writing; unexpected state (already `Accepted`, `Superseded`) → flag, don't clobber. **Never move a spec out of `Assumed`** (that is ratification, `/architect`'s job): an `Assumed` spec stays `Assumed` through the build even while the feature is `in-progress`, so it can never reach `Accepted` until `/architect` ratifies it. The feature itself can still be marked `done` (the engineer's call); the `Assumed` spec stays flagged as owing ratification, it does not block `done`.
- Artifact base: `docs/` by default, `.workflow/` if `docs/` is a published docs site. Read from whichever exists (paths here assume `docs/`).
- Shared scope: read it again right before ticking, edit only the specific checkbox, status, or pointer line (never rewrite the file); feature not as expected (already `done`, reworked) → flag, don't overwrite.

## Portability (any OS, any agent)

Any Agent Skills client, macOS/Linux/Windows. Detection snippets are POSIX reference; use your agent's own cross platform file tools. Builds inline on the main thread (Step 3); the only subagents are a read only `scout` that explores code (Step 2.5) and a read only `researcher` for a doc check (Step 2.6, degrading to building from knowledge without web capability), both on the cheapest model. Bundled guides (`ui-guide.md`, `logical-guide.md`, `checklist.md`) and the build flow after the gate (`flow/build.md`) are paths relative to this skill's folder; the main thread reads them. No interactive question picker → ask the prompts as plain text with the same options.

## Execution

### Before you build: the project must already exist (except the scaffold task)

Exception: if this IS the scaffold sub task of the Stack and architecture foundation feature (prompt says `scaffold`, or the step initializes the project from the stack spec), creating the project IS the job. Read the ARCHITECTURE spec's `## Proposed stack`; run the framework's own project initializer for the stack the spec names; install base dependencies (framework, core runtime, only what the first slice needs); lay out directories; confirm a dev server or build runs. **Keep the repo the initializer creates (never discard it when relocating the project); if it made none and git integration is on, `git init`.** Scaffold steps derive from the stack decision (a decision spec has no build plan). Install just in time: NOT every library the spec names (email, monitoring, and so on); each later feature installs its own when built; only cross cutting tooling (lint, format, type strictness) comes early, via `/audit` + the tooling task. Then proceed.

Otherwise `/develop` builds into an existing project. No skeleton (no `package.json`/`pyproject.toml`/`go.mod`/manifest, no source tree) and not the scaffold task → stop:

> No project found to build into. Run the scaffold step first (the Stack and architecture feature's scaffold sub task, per your architecture spec), then run `/develop` again.

A project exists (even a bare scaffold) → proceed.

### Before you build: freshness & collaboration (don't build on stale state or over a teammate)

Before mutating anything (skip silently if solo, offline, or not using git): `git fetch` quietly; base = `main`, else `master`; behind count (`git rev-list --count HEAD..origin/<base>`); uncommitted work (`git status --short`).

- Behind (count > 0) → stop and warn: "You're N commits behind `origin/$BASE`. A teammate may have already changed or shipped this. Pull first, then run again."
- Uncommitted work in the area you'll touch → warn: "You have uncommitted changes here. Commit or stash first so this build doesn't tangle with them." Let them proceed if they insist.
- Feature `in-progress` in the scope AND its code area (pointer line's path) has recent commits by another author (`git log --format='%an' -- <area>`) → warn: "*<feature>* looks like it's partway through the build by someone else. Coordinate before continuing it." Confirm before proceeding.

Warnings, not hard blocks, but surface them.

**Git integration:** if the nearest `AGENTS.md` `## Git` says `integration: on`, read `flow/git.md` and follow it (branch before building, commit as milestones land); absent or `off` → do no active git.

### Step 0: The spec gate (always first)

Is a decision owed and unrecorded? Do NOT judge this by introspection ("do I feel like I'm inventing something?"), the build model rationalizes a real decision as "just wiring" and waves it through. Use a positive **input coverage** test, which is mechanical and harder to talk yourself out of:

> **Enumerate every value this build must produce, compute, or display (from the acceptance criteria and the spec's design). For each, does the spec name where it comes from (an input, a DB column, a derivation from a named value, a prior decision)? Any required value with no named source is an owed decision.**

If any source is unnamed, stop and route to the gate (`/architect`, or record an `Assumed` spec; `/develop` implements decisions, it doesn't make them). A decision is also owed when you'd have to invent:

- **A provider, library, integration, data model, or cross cutting pattern** (e.g. auth provider, DB/ORM, caching strategy).
- **A whole UI page or screen**: its design system (`design.md` there? if not, which direction?), sections/composition, component inventory, asset strategy (no screenshot, no repo images → e.g. an online source). Owed unless a `design.md` AND a page level spec pin these down.
- **A feature's behavior** (search, a wizard: "what exactly should it do?" is open; `/architect` asks those questions). Owed unless a spec defines it.

**What "local implementation detail" actually means (the narrow exception):** ONLY a choice among options the spec's named sources already permit, a loop style, a variable name, which helper to call. The moment a choice **determines a value's source, or a behavior an acceptance criterion constrains**, it is load bearing by definition, however small it looks. Deriving "the user's today from the timezone on their last read row" is not a local detail: it picks the source of a value an AC constrains, so it is owed. NOT owed for genuine pure implementation: a small bug fix, a component matching an existing `design.md`, wiring pieces whose sources the spec already names, a copy tweak, anything an existing spec/`design.md`/`AGENTS.md` fully governs.

Don't hardcode to page names or to any one example (timezone is an illustration of the pattern, not a rule); apply the input coverage test to whatever was asked. False negatives are the failure mode, building a real decision without noticing: when a required value's source is unnamed, or you are unsure, treat as owed and ask (panel below).

Read only what this feature needs, never the whole `docs/` tree: its one scope file and its one governing spec (single file, or umbrella `index.md` plus the one child speccing this sub task). No other features' rows, scope files, workspaces, or unrelated specs.

**Check, in order:**
1. **Locate this feature's scope file (only that one).** Monorepo → `docs/scope/<workspace>/` for the task's package. Pick the file (`scope.md`, or the matching `<epic>.md` in a split) from the At a glance table alone; read just this feature's section. `needs a decision` with no spec pointer yet → decision owed and missing. Malformed → flag and ask, don't guess.
2. **Open the governing spec via the feature's `spec` pointer**, reading only its build spec sections as defined in the build flow (`flow/build.md`), Step 2 item 1. Found → it's the spec; proceed. No pointer and no linked spec → targeted look in `docs/specs/<workspace>/` for one matching this feature's scope, never a blanket read.
3. The **nearest** `AGENTS.md` (workspace/area) may already capture the decision, synced from an earlier feature (e.g. "the auth provider is already chosen") → proceed without a new spec.

Decision owed and unrecorded → don't guess, don't silently stop. Ask (single select; `AskUserQuestion` on Codex):

- **question**: "This looks like it needs an architecture decision first: `<name the specific load-bearing choice, e.g. 'which auth provider + session model'>`. How do you want to handle it?"
- **header**: "spec first?"
- **options**:
  1. `Architect it first`: "Recommended. Capture the decision in a spec before building, so the build has a spec." → **end here** with the handoff below. Do not build.
  2. `No, not needed`: "I've judged there's no real decision here; build directly." → proceed to the build flow (`flow/build.md`).
  3. `Build now, record it as an assumed spec`: "Build it, but write the assumption down first so the decision lives in the repo, not just this chat. The `Assumed` spec stays flagged as owing ratification (`/architect`), but that never blocks marking the feature `done`." → write an `Assumed` spec (below), then proceed to the build flow (`flow/build.md`), leaving the feature `in-progress` with an `assumed decision (spec NNNN)` note in the scope (`docs/scope/`).

The tool appends "Other" as a free text option automatically.

On `Build now, record it as an assumed spec`, write a minimal `Assumed` spec **before** building (this is the one narrow spec write `/develop` owns; see Artifact ownership). Resolve `$SPEC_DIR` the way `/architect` does (single repo → `docs/specs/`; monorepo workspace → `docs/specs/<workspace>/`), take the next free `NNNN`, and write `$SPEC_DIR/NNNN-<slug>.md`:

```markdown
# NNNN · <feature>

**Status**: Assumed
**Date**: <today>
**Authorized by**: <engineer>, during /develop

## Owed decision
<the specific load bearing choice that was not made>

## Assumption built on
<the concrete assumption this build will use>

## Code area
<the paths this build will touch>

## Requirements
<acceptance criteria seeds carried from the scope Done when, if any>

## Ratify
This decision was recorded by /develop, not deliberated. Run `/architect <feature>`
to deliberate and ratify it. Until then it stays flagged as an owed decision; it does not block marking the feature `done`.
```

Point the feature's scope `spec` line at this file. The assumption is now durable: it survives `/clear`, teammates read it, and a later `/develop` builds against it instead of guessing again. The `Assumed` spec stays flagged as owing ratification; it does not block marking the feature `done` (see `flow/build.md`, Step 4).

On `Architect it first`, end with:

> Run this next, then come back to `/develop`:
> ```
> /architect <feature>: <the specific decision to settle>
> ```
> Once the spec exists, run `/develop <task>` again and I'll build to it.

No decision owed (pure implementation) → skip the question, proceed.

### Build flow (Steps 1-4)

Once the gate clears (no decision owed, or the engineer chose `No, not needed` / `Build now, record it as an assumed spec`), read `flow/build.md` and follow its Steps 1-4: classify the track, load the decision and conventions, explore, optional doc check, build, then update the scope and report. Do not read `flow/build.md` when the gate ends the run (`Architect it first`, no build).
